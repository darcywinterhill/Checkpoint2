# Checkpoint2
Mini project with different levels during System developer .NET studies @ Lexicon.
Written in C#.

## Project description
A console app that asks the user for:
1. Category
2. Product name
3. Price

  - A minimum of two classes
  - Add products to list
  - Be able to quit by typing "q"
  - Present a list when entering "q"
  - The products sorted in the list, price low - high
  - The prices summarized and showing in the end
  - Error handling

## Room for improvement
- Move some methods and code from Program.cs to the class files to make it airier in the Program file
- Improve the structure to be able to add products AND search for products after list is displayed
